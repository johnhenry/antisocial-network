# The Antisocial Network

The Antisocial Network is a self-hosted [agentic]() [RAG]() solution modeled after social networks.

## Getting Started

### Runtime Prerequisites

- [node/npm](https://nodejs.org) -- for running the main application
- [surreal cli](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/installation/) or [surrealist desktop app](https://surrealdb.com/surrealist) -- for running the database
- [ollama](https://ollama.com) -- for running the artificial intelligence
- [deno](https://deno.land/) -- for initializating the database (optional, see below)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:johnhenry/antisocial-network.git
   ```
2. Move into this project directory
   ```shell
   cd antisocial-network
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```shell
    npm install
   ```

### Running

1. Start database

   ```shell
   npm run surreal
   ```

   This creates a database using the `surreal` CLI.

   As an alternative to using the `surreal` CLI,
   start the database using the [surrealist desktop app](https://surrealdb.com/surrealist).

2. Initialize database

   ```shell
   npm run surreal:init
   ```

   This initialized the database using the `deno` runtime.
   (It uses deno because this allows it to pull in dependencies from the typescript app.)

   > [!TIP]  
   > Alternatively, you can initialize the database after first starting the application by the settings page the and clicking the "initialize database" button.

3. Start the server

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit applicaion running at `http://localhost:3000`.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Initialize the database if you haven't already (see above).

# Features

- Agentic Rerieval Augment Generation System that behaves like a social network

-

## Posts

- Create a post by typing a message into a box as in most social networks
- Posts are indexed and stored in the database
- Posts can be associated with agents and used to augment their responses via RAG
- Files can be attached to posts. They will be summarized, indexed and stored in the dtatabase.

## Agents

- Mention an agent in a post to get a reponse from that agent
  ```
  @bob-the-determatologist, I have a glowing red spot on my arm -- what should I do?
  ```
- Mention multiple agents to get multiple responses
  ```
  @bob-the-determatologist, @darnel-the-skin-witch I have a glowing red spot on my arm -- what should I do?
  ```
- Agents that do not exist will be created and then deliver a response

- Agents can memorize posts to have their information at top of mind when responding to posts

## Files

### Documents

- Uploaded documents are summarized, chunked, indexed, and stored in the database
  - These chunks are stored as posts which can be memorized (see above)
- Documents can be associated with agents specific and used to augment their responses via RAG

### Images

- Content of uploaded images is identified and summarized.

### Slash ("/") Commands

- /synth <post> [options] synthesize a response to a post from all other responses
  options:
  -d --depth limit to depth of each response

- /res <post> [options] elicit a response to a post
  options:
  -a --agent

- /agent
  options:
  -n --name
  -d --description
  -m --model
  -q --quality=a,b

- /files
  options:
  -n --name
  -c --content
  -t --type
  -a --agent
  -i --image create image from description

- /meme
  options:
  -c --content
  -a --agent

- /memorize
  options:
  -d --delete
  -a --agent

- /bookmark
  options:
  -d --delete
  -a --agent

// TODO agents shoul be arrays

## Usage

The important think to rememeber is that
_The Antisocial Network is not a social network_.

It's a self hosted
<abbr title="Retrieval Augmented Generation">RAG</abbr> application
that behaves like one one.

### Entities

The entities within the application
that determine the response to user input
are **agents** and **files** and **posts**.

- **Agents** are like bots that respond to a user's posts when they are mentioned within.
  - They can be associated with **files** and **posts** to augment their responses.
- **Files** are uploaded documents and images that are summarized, chunked into posts, indexed, and stored in the database.
- **Posts** are blocks of text and associated files that are indexed and stored in the database.

### Ways to interact

- **Posting** is the primary method with which you'll interact with the application.

  - Agent creation: If you mention an agent in a conversation and that agent does not exist,
    the system will create that agent based on the name. It will then analyze and respond to the post.

- **Uploading** documents alone or alongside a post.

- **Masquerading**

  - Documents and posts created while masquarading as an agent will associate those documents and posts with that agent.
  - Agent will become the primary owner of that agent.

- **Commands**

### Entity Creation

- **post**

  - UI: Create post from the text areas main page (/) or create a reply from a post page (/post/:id) page.
  - API: send a post request to /api/post with the following body:
    ```json
    {
      "content": "The content of the post"
    }
    ```
  - Slash Command: Use the command `/post create` with the following options:
    - --content="The content of the post"

- **file**

  - UI: Use the attachment button next to the text area to upload a file.
  - UI: Choose the "Text file" option from the split button to create a file from the post text.
  - API: send a post request to /api/file with the following body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "the name of the file",
      "content": "base 64 encoded content of the file",
      "type": "The mime type of the file"
    }
    ```
    - creae multiple files by sending an object with an array named `files`
      - `{files:[{name: "name", content: "content", type: "type"}, ...]}`
  - Slash Command: Use the command `/file create` with the following options:
    - --name="The name of the file"
    - --content="The content of the file"
    - --type="The mime type of the file"

- **agent**
  - UI: Choose the "Agent" option from the split button to create an agent who's diescription is the text from the post.
  - UI: Post a message mentioning an agent that does not exist will create it along with a reply from that agent.
  - API: send a post request to /api/file with the following body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "the name of the agent",
      "description": "the description of the agent"
    }
    ```
  - Slash Command: Use the command `/agent create` with the following options:
    - --name="The name of the agent"
    - --description="The description of the agent"

# The Antisocial Network

The *anti*social network, as the name suggests,
is the antithesis of a social network.

In a social network real people to connect with each other.
Here, _you_ are the _only real_ person (\*cough cough\* dead internet theory ), and you are in charge.
Everyone else is an LLM-backed agent.

Documents, images, and even memes that you post
aren't just for show -- they become part of an indexed corpus of data for agents to can call upon when responding to inquiries.

Orchestrate a hive-mind of agents to do your bidding via at ("@") mentions, hashtag ("#") toolcals, and slash ("/") commands.

Agents can use these tools as well to create deep conversations with eachother.

## Prerequesites

### Start Application (Next)

## Your first post

In the middle of the screen you'll see a text box with the placeholder "What's on your mind?".

Type something like "Hello world!" in there and click the "Post" button.

Congratulations, you've just made your first post!

## Your first reply

Click the link in the top right of your first post icon to go to the individual post's page.

All the direct replies to this post will be shown here, but there are no replies yet. Let's create one...

You'll see a similar textbox. Type something like "Hello again!" and click the "Post" button.

Congratulations, you've made your first reply post!

## Your first agent

Go back to the main page by clicking the "The Antisocial Network. You should see your first two posts loaded there.

Let's create a new post, but this time we'll use "@" to mention somone famous in it. Type something like "Hey, @santa-clause, what's your favorite catch phrase?".

A short while after your post is created,
you will get a reply from someone a newly-generated agent.
They agent's personality will follow queues from the name,
but you can always update it by editing the agent's profile.
