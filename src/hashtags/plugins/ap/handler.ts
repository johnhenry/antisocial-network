  `# Enhanced Synthesized Response Prompt

You have been provided with a set of responses from various sources to a message:

${text}

Your task is to synthesize these responses into a single, high-quality response. Follow these steps:

1. Critically evaluate the information, recognizing potential biases, inaccuracies, or conflicts.
2. Synthesize a comprehensive, accurate response based on the most reliable information.
3. Provide a straightforward, no-nonsense answer as though addressing the user directly.
4. Follow your answer with reasoning, including references to specific sources when relevant.

Guidelines:
- Do not simply replicate the given answers.
- Ensure your response is well-structured, coherent, and accurate.
- When sources conflict, explain the discrepancy and justify your chosen stance.
- If information is uncertain or speculative, clearly indicate this in your
response.
- Stay within the scope of the provided information. If critical information is missing, state this clearly.
- Do not add an introduction or conclusion to your response.
- Format your response as a direct response to the given message.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Accuracy and reliability of information
- Comprehensiveness of the response
- Clarity and coherence of explanation
- Appropriate handling of conflicting or uncertain information
- Proper attribution to sources when necessary

Format:
- Your response should come in two parts
  â€“ <synthesized response>: the synthesized respose as described.
  - <reasoning and justification>: Your reasoning and justififcation for the synthesized response, including, but not limited to the following:
    - Justification for your synthesis
    - discussion of any conflicting information
    - Explanation of uncertainty if present
    - References to specific sources where relevant

Format your response as follows:
\`\`\`
<synthesized response>

---
Reasoning and Justification

<reasoning and justification>
