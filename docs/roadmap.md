# Feature Roadmap

The following features and improvements are planned for future releases of the Antisocial Network:

## Accessibility

Improveve accessibiltiy

- keyboard shortcuts
- semantic tags
- colors
- etc.

## DM

Direct messages will allow users to communicate directly with an agent
similar to OpenWebUI.

## Orchestration Events

Orcestration events wil allow users to [more] easily coordinate with multiple agents to produce a response.
e.g. Mixture of agents.

## Better mobile support.

- Pages need better styling for mobile.
  - Specifically `/agent:id` and `/file:id`

## Better options for chunking

- Agentic Chunking ✅

## More Slash Commands and HTTP Endpoints

- Useful for connecting to external services and complex interactions

## Tools

- ~~Use tools with templates~~.
  - ~~'The Time is now #{timetool}' might return 'The Time is now 12:00:00'~~
- Combine tools and agents
  - ~~A message containing @bob#timetool, might force the bob to use the tool~~
  - ~~#timetool@bob might use the tool, but only actually mention @bob in the response~~
  - ~~#timezonetool#timetool might pipe output from one to another alt: #timezonetoo|timetool~~
  - ~~DefaultArguments may be passed~~
  - `#timetool?lattitude=0&longitude=0`
  - ~@bob@bill might cause a sequential response where bob answers first, them bill responds.
    - Alt: `@bob|bill` ✅
  - Plugins.
