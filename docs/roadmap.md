# Feature Roadmap

The following features and improvements are planned for future releases of the Antisocial Network:

## Accessibility

Improveve accessibiltiy

- keyboard shortcuts
- semantic tags
- colors
- etc.

## DM

Direct messages will allow users to communicate directly with an agent
similar to OpenWebUI.

## Orchestration Events

Orcestration events wil allow users to [more] easily coordinate with multiple agents to produce a response.
e.g. Mixture of agents.

## Better mobile support.

- Pages need better styling for mobile.
  - Specifically `/agent:id` and `/file:id`

## Better options for chunking

- Agentic Chunking

## More Slash Commands and HTTP Endpoints

- Useful for connecting to external services and complex interactions

## Tools

- Use tools with templates.
  - 'The Time is now #{timetool}' might return 'The Time is now 12:00:00'
- Combine tools and agents
  - A message containing @bob#timetool, might force the bob to use the tool
  - #timetool@bob might use the tool, but only actually mention @bob in the response
  - #timezonetool#timetool might pipe output from one to another alt: #timezonetoo|timetool
  - DefaultArguments may be passed
  - `#timetool?lattitude=0&longitude=0`
  - @bob@bill might cause a sequential response where
    - Alt: `@bob|bill`
  - bob answers first, them bill responds.
  - Plugins.

# Bugs

These are some observed bugs that we're looking into fixing.

- When using "@" or "#" to insert mentions and tools,
  the cursor is placed in the middle of the added word rather than at the end

- There appears to be a way to [accidentally] add an agent to the bibliography?

- New posts do not render properly when first added to lists
  - They render properly upon refresh
- Search results show items multiple times and out of order
- Masquerading remains after clearing database
  - Masquerade is stored in local storage
